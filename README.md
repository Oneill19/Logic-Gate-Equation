# Logic Gates Equation
### Logic Gates Equation program to symplify equations and demonstrate the OOP principles.

The program built using Java.
<br>
This program built in my second year in my studies to demonstarte the OOP principles:
1. Abstarction - Define certain functions for the gates.
2. Encapsulation - Save the gates array to only be visible to all the gates classes.
3. Inheritence - All the specific gates inherit from the main Gate class.
4. Polymorphism - All the gates have their own implementation to their methods.

<p>
    For example the program will represent the equation A U B as OR[A, B].
    <br>
    In the main class there are some examples for some gates, their final solve and their simplified form.
</p>

### Important methods:
- calc() - method to return the calculation of the gate using func() method of every specific gate.
- simplify() - return simplified equation for the gate.
